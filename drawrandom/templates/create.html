<p>This tool allows you to create a list of secret roles, teams or identities and have each person draw one randomly. Create a list separated by newlines. Enter as many items as you like. Once you click 'Submit' you will get a link that anyone can visit to be given one of the items from the list in secret.</p>
<p>You can use this tool when you are playing a game online that requires you to give each player a secret role, identity or objective, or you can separate players into teams (for example in a 6 player game with 2 teams you can add 3 entries of each team.) You can enter a word or a whole sentence on each line, so this tool can be used for any task which requires everyone to secretly be given a random item from a list.</p>
